# WhatsCooking
Playing around with the What's Cooking Yummly dataset on Kaggle.

Primarily wanted to get acquainted with the dataset and refamiliarize myself with scikit-learn. 

Have implemented many different classifiers which include the use of all of the following:
- Count vectorization 
- TFIDF feature extraction
- Using featureunion from sklearn
- Support vector classification (SVC)
- Logistic regression
- Random forests
- XGBoost
- Neural networks(implemented with Keras)
- other simple / random pre-processing steps

As of the time of writing this I have placed 126.

Will add a script to run my classifiers soon and codebase needs cleaning(remove messy notebooks).
